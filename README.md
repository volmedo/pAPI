pAPI is a payments API written in Go, a fictional service that offers standard CRUD functionality on `Payment` resources.

The main objective of this repo is serving as an example of what I consider modern software engineering practices applied to the development of backend architectures based in microservices. It is aimed at covering not only the development of the software itself, but also the tools and strategies needed to walk the full way from writing code to getting the service in production, following the principles around agile development and DevOps.
